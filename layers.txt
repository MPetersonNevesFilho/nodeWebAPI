N-Layers


src - contains the source code of the application
    entities - object mappings
    factories - instant factories
    repositories - data access
    routes - endpoints mapping
    services - communication between the routes and repositories layer (business logic)
    utils - helper functions (shared code)
    handler communication between the routes and services layer (error handling)
    database - a file which contains the database schema and the data

tests -> all automated test suites
    integration tests - test on the user point of view. Also an E2E test because there's no app layer
    unit tests - test on the developer point of view. Test each layer separately
